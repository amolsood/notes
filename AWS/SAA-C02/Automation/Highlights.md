# Automation

## Points

- Benefits
  - Saves time
  - Easier to prevent security incidents
  - Consistent results of an action every single time
- Services
  - CloudFormation - IAC - Infrastructure as Code
  - Elastic Beanstalk - Easy to use Drag and drop creator for AWS Architecture
  - Systems Manager

### CloudFormation

- CloudFormation is a declarative programming language.
- Supports JSON or YAML formatting
- Sections
  - InputParameters - Allows to set input variables at runtime
  - Mappings - Allows to put values for template to run
  - Resources - Resources which are going to be created when ran
- Hard coded values and resource IDs can be reason templates fail to create
- If template finds an error, CloudFormation rolls back to last known good state
- Just a set of API calls underneath. It makes the same API calls which we make manually, but faster, immutable and in automated way

### Elastic Beanstalk

- Is Amazon PaaS (Platform-as-a-service) tool. One stop for everything AWS related
- Automation - Lets to automate all the deployments
- Deployment - Handles the deployments. Just upload the code, test code in staging and then deploy to production
- Management - Handles building out the insides of EC2 instances
- Supports containers, Windows and Linux applications
- Great solution for simpler applications, not for complex, big applications
- Not serverless. Creates and manages a standard EC2 architecture

### Systems Manager

- Collections of tools to manage EC2 architecture and on-premises architecture
- Systems Manager agent has to be installed on the EC2 instance
- Features
  - Automation Documents - Can be used to control instances or other AWS resources
  - Run Command - Execute commands on hosts or the whole fleet
  - Patch Manager - Manages application versions
  - Parameter Store - Securely store secret values
  - Hybrid Activations - Control on-premises architecture using Systems manager
  - Session Manager - Remotely connect and interact with architecture
- Application of Parameter Store - Store variables which can be loaded at runtime, without keeping secret keys on GitHub or anywhere else
- Secrets Manager enables you to replace hardcoded credentials in your code (including passwords), with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. Also, you can configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secret for you according to a schedule that you specify. This enables you to replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, which helps to significantly reduce the risk of compromise.
- Parameter Store
  - For Standard parameters, No additional charge for storage and standard throughput. For higher throughput, API interactions cost is $0.05 per 10,000 API calls.
  - For Advanced parameters, storage cost is $0.05 per advanced parameter per month and API interactions cost is $0.05 per 10,000 API calls.
  - You can write your own function that updates credentials managed by Parameter Store, and invoking it via a CloudWatch scheduled event or EventBridge.
  - Cross account access not supported
  - Standard Parameters can store up to 4096 characters (4KB size) for each entry, and Advanced Parameters can store up to 8KB entries
  - It doesnâ€™t support cross region replication out of the box
- Secrets Manager
  - It is paid. The storage cost is $0.40 per secret per month and API interactions cost is $0.05 per 10,000 API calls
  - It offers the ability to switch secrets at any given time and can be configured to regularly rotate depending on your requirements
  - It provides full key rotation integration with few AWS service like RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB. For other services, AWS allows you to write custom key rotation logic using an AWS Lambda function.
  - Secrets can be accessed from another AWS account. It easier to share the secrets cross-accounts
  - It can store up to 10KB secret size
  - It lets you easily replicate your secrets in multiple AWS Regions to support applications spread across those Regions as well as disaster recovery scenarios.

## Exam Tips

- Automate everything!
- Automation via CloudFormation is perfect for creating immutable architecture
- Systems Manager is rarely called by its name, it will be called by the features. E.g - Automation documents to fix S3 bucket permissions or using Session Manager to connect to an instance
- 4 questions to ask
  - Can you automate - Yes
  - What kind of automation works in given scenario
  - Is automation repeatable
  - Will this work cross-region or cross-account - No hard-coding of resources
- Immutable architecture is preferable - Stateless is better
- Mappings or Parameter store to store secrets or resources IDs and makes template more flexible
- Elastic Beanstalk is a one-stop IT shop for AWS things
- Automation documents are primary method to configure the inside of an EC2 instance
